This is an early version of TGC.

To run the code, you need:

1 Download the datasets from [[Data4TGC](https://github.com/MGitHubL/Data4TGC)] and create "data" folder in the same directory as the "emb" and "framework" folders.

2 Run the 'main.py' in the ./framework folder.

3 Run the 'clustering.py' in the ./framework/experiments folder.

Note that the node embeddings in the 'emb' folder are just placeholders, you need to run the main code to generate them.
