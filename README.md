This is an early version of TGC.

To run the code, you need:

1 Download the pretrain embeddings from [[release](https://github.com/MGitHubL/TGC/releases/tag/pretrain.emb)], and then unzip it into the ./framework/pretrain folder.

2 Run the 'main.py' in the ./framework folder.

3 Run the 'clustering.py' in the ./framework/experiments folder.

Note that the node embeddings in the 'emb' folder are just placeholders, you need to run the main code to generate them.
